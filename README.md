gdt-better-names
================

A mod for Game Dev Tycoon that provides better default names for games

This mod replaces the default game numbering scheme (Game #1, Game #2 etc) 
with some more meaningful names that depend on the genre and the topic.
The names is changed after every choice of genre or topic, so if you want
to use a custom name, change it at the end.

Sequels are handled differently. The mod will try to use a game number scheme
(GameName, GameName 2, GameName 3) and won't change the name even if you change 
topic or genre.

## Disclaimer

This is just the result of a few hours of patchwork, and it is the equivalent of 
sharpening a pencil with a chainsaw.
It shouldn't be able to do any damage to your savegames though, so at most you will
have to disable it.

## BUGS/TODO

A lot :).

* Some names may not make sense at all.
* Multi-topic games aren't handled yet.
* Only english names are supported for now. Probably it won't work with localized settings
* Some topic are not handled yet
* Would be nice to provide name for game engines too.
